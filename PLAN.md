# CHM to Wiki.js Markdown Converter Project Plan

This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for converting CHM (Compiled HTML Help) files to Wiki.js-compatible Markdown.

## CHM Extraction Method

### Approach

1. **File-Based Processing**:
   - Process one CHM file at a time to minimize memory usage
   - Extract CHM content to disk rather than keeping it in memory
   - Use the `pychm` library to access CHM file structure and content

2. **Streaming Extraction**:
   - Read CHM content in chunks (8KB) to avoid loading large files into memory
   - Process each topic individually and immediately write to disk
   - Track processed files using a hash map to avoid duplicate processing

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling for corrupted CHM files
   - Log warnings for unprocessable content without halting the entire process
   - Provide detailed error messages for troubleshooting

## Markdown Conversion Strategy

### HTML to Markdown Conversion

1. **Parsing Approach**:
   - Use BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content
   - Process HTML elements recursively to maintain document structure
   - Apply Wiki.js-specific formatting rules during conversion

2. **Wiki.js Compliance**:
   - Follow Wiki.js Markdown standards as outlined in MarkDownTips.md and Wiki_Authoring_Standards.md
   - Ensure proper formatting for headers, lists, code blocks, tables, and other elements
   - Implement post-processing to clean up and standardize the output

3. **Asset Handling**:
   - Extract and save images to the `/assets/` directory as required by Wiki.js
   - Update image references in Markdown to use the correct paths
   - Preserve other media files with appropriate references

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Process one topic at a time
   - Write converted Markdown to disk immediately after conversion
   - Use generators and streaming where possible to minimize memory footprint

2. **Performance**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
   - Use hash maps to track processed content and avoid redundant work
   - Parallelize processing where appropriate without excessive memory usage

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Validate Markdown output against Wiki.js standards
   - Implement checks for common conversion issues
   - Provide warnings for potentially problematic content

## GitHub Workflow Plan

### Repository Structure

1. **Main Repository (CHM Processor)**:
   - Contains all processing code and logic
   - Excludes CHM files and extracted content via .gitignore
   - Includes documentation and tests

2. **Output Repository (Markdown Content)**:
   - Separate repository for the generated Markdown files
   - Structured according to Wiki.js requirements
   - Includes assets directory for images and other media

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Develop features in logical, incremental steps
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages
   - Push to main repository regularly

2. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Test with sample CHM files of varying complexity
   - Validate output against Wiki.js standards

3. **Deployment**:
   - Use the CLI to process CHM files
   - Automatically commit and push generated Markdown to the output repository
   - Document the process for end users

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Review conversion quality regularly
   - Address issues and edge cases as they are discovered
   - Refine conversion rules based on Wiki.js rendering results

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Track memory usage and processing time
   - Identify and address bottlenecks
   - Optimize for larger CHM files as needed

## Implementation Timeline

   - Implement GitHub repository integration
   - Add logging and error handling

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization**
   - Comprehensive testing with various CHM files
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation and final adjustments
