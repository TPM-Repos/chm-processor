Example: Running Code in Response to Specification Events

Glossary Item Box

# Introduction

This example shows how you can run code whenever certain events occur related to specifications.

There are lots of [events on the SpecificationContext](topic11149.md) that you can handle to run code at different times.

![](images/hs-tip.gif) |  Specification Context is an important class in DriveWorks. Specification Contexts are created by DriveWorks whenever it needs to work with a specification, not just for running a specification. This means, for example, that merely clicking on a specification in the Specification Explorer will result in a Specification Context being created so that DriveWorks can properly evaluate which operations and transitions are valid for that specification. This means that it is important not to perform any sort of expensive operations when a Specification Context is created - instead, handle the specific events on the Specification Context that you are interested in, and do your processing there.
