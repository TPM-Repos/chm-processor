# Remarks

DriveWorks supports the notion of a metadata directory which is a directory inside the specification directory in which the design master, project file, and related metadata are stored. If used, this feature prevents the specification directory from becoming cluttered with information which DriveWorks uses to manage the specification.

If the metadirectory name is zero-length or a null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic), then DriveWorks will place metadata files in the specification directory.
