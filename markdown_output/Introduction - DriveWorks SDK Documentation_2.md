There are two main uses of the DriveWorks Engine

  * To create extensions to DriveWorks by creating an [Extension Library](topic4.md) \- for example, specification flow conditions and tasks, documents, application plugins, and others.
  * To create a [Project Extender](topic9.md) \- an extension to a DriveWorks project which provides that project with user defined functions (not available in Excel projects) and/or macros (available in both Excel and DriveWorks projects).
