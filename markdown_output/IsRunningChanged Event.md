Glossary Item Box

Raised when specification enters or leaves a running state. 

# Syntax

Visual Basic (Declaration)|   
---|---  
      
    
    Public Event IsRunningChanged As EventHandler  
  
Visual Basic (Usage)| Copy Code  
---|---  
      
    
    Dim instance As [SpecificationContext](topic11149.md)
    Dim handler As EventHandler
    Â 
    AddHandler instance.IsRunningChanged, handler  
  
C#|   
---|---  
      
    
    public event EventHandler IsRunningChanged  
  
# Remarks

If the specification enters the running state because a task requires it, the [IsRunningChanged](topic11262.md) event doesn't fire as it is intended to detect state changes as the result of a specification action such as a transition or copy operation.
