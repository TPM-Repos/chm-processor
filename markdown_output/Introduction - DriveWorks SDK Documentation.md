The SolidWorks extensibility library provides extensibility types specific to DriveWorks' SolidWorks addin and DriveWorks Autopilot.

The main services provided by the SolidWorks extensibility library are:

  * [ISolidWorksService Interface](topic13411.md) for getting access to the SolidWorks instance being used by a DriveWorks application.


  * [IGenerationService Interface](topic15147.md) for reacting to models as they are being generated by DriveWorks.
